                <h3>to <span class="coloured-text">achieve goal</span> </h3>
                <p>Many employers require employees to collaborate on projects to achieve a shared goal. Students
                    experience this when asked to be a member of a diverse team in order to successfully complete a
                    class project. Group projects can be particularly challenging in online courses when learners are
                    geographically separated and often reside in different time zones.The most critical element to a
                    successful group project is each member recognizing their responsibility to the group. Achieving an
                    excellent grade is a reflection of everyone completing their assigned tasks, consistently
                    communicating with the group, and actively collaborating with others. . Working as a team will
                    require all participants to be open and engaged with each other in order to actively learn from each
                    other.</p>
